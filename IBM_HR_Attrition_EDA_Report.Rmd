## 🧭 Project Title: IBM HR Analytics — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 🎯 Objective  
The goal of this project is to explore the IBM HR Analytics dataset to understand the factors that influence **employee attrition** — that is, why employees leave the company.  
By analyzing patterns and relationships in the data, HR teams can take proactive measures to improve employee retention and job satisfaction.

## 📊 **Univariate Analysis**

### 🔹 1. Age Distribution
**Question:** What is the age distribution of employees?

```{r}
hist(data$Age,
     col = "skyblue",
     main = "Age Distribution of Employees",
     xlab = "Age")
```

**Insight:**  
Most employees are between **30 and 40 years old**. Few are younger than 25 or older than 55, suggesting a workforce dominated by mid-career professionals.

---

### 🔹 2. Attrition Count (Yes / No)
**Question:** What proportion of employees have left the company?

```{r}
barplot(table(data$Attrition),
        col = c("lightgreen", "salmon"),
        main = "Attrition Count (Yes / No)",
        ylab = "Number of Employees")
```

**Insight:**  
The majority of employees have **not left** (Attrition = No). Around **15–20%** have left, indicating a moderate turnover rate.

---

### 🔹 3. Employee Count by Department
**Question:** How are employees distributed across departments?

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Department)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "orange") +
  labs(title = "Employee Count by Department", x = "Department", y = "Count")
```

**Insight:**  
The **Research & Development** department has the highest number of employees, followed by **Sales**. The **Human Resources** department has the fewest employees.

---

## 🔗 **Bivariate Analysis**

### 🔹 4. Age vs Attrition
**Question:** Does age influence employee attrition?

```{r}
boxplot(Age ~ Attrition,
        data = data,
        col = c("lightblue", "pink"),
        main = "Age vs Attrition",
        xlab = "Attrition",
        ylab = "Age")
```

**Insight:**  
Employees who left tend to be **younger**. This suggests that **younger employees are more likely to leave**, possibly seeking career growth elsewhere.

---

### 🔹 5. Attrition Rate by Department
**Question:** How does attrition vary across departments?

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Department, fill = Attrition)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Attrition Rate by Department", y = "Proportion") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
```

**Insight:**  
Attrition appears **higher in Sales** than in Research & Development. Departmental work culture or job type could influence turnover.

---

### 🔹 6. Daily Rate vs Distance From Home
**Question:** Is there a relationship between salary (daily rate) and distance from home?

```{r}
plot(data$DailyRate, data$DistanceFromHome,
     main = "Daily Rate vs Distance From Home",
     xlab = "Daily Rate",
     ylab = "Distance From Home",
     col = "steelblue", pch = 19)
```

**Insight:**  
No clear trend — distance from home does not strongly affect salary or attrition. It may not be a significant factor.

---

### 🔹 7. Age vs Daily Rate (Colored by Attrition)
**Question:** How do age and salary relate to attrition?

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Age, y = DailyRate, color = Attrition)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Age vs DailyRate coloured by Attrition")
```

**Insight:**  
Employees with **lower daily rates** and **younger ages** are more likely to leave. Pay and experience might jointly influence attrition decisions.

---

### 🔹 8. Attrition by Department and Business Travel
**Question:** How does business travel frequency relate to attrition across departments?

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Department, fill = BusinessTravel)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~Attrition) +
  labs(title = "Attrition by Department and Business Travel")
```

**Insight:**  
In **Sales**, employees who travel frequently show more attrition. **Non-traveling employees** in R&D are more stable, suggesting travel stress may contribute to turnover.

---

## 🧮 **Multivariate Summary**
By looking at multiple variables together:
- **Younger**, **lower-paid**, and **frequent travelers** in **Sales** tend to leave more often.  
- **Distance from home** doesn’t significantly impact attrition.  
- Different departments have distinct retention patterns.

---

## 🏁 **Final Conclusion**

This EDA reveals key insights into employee attrition at IBM:

- **Age & Salary** are major predictors — younger and lower-paid employees are more likely to leave.  
- **Department & Travel** also matter — Sales staff and frequent travelers show higher turnover.  
- **Distance from home** is not a strong factor.  

### 💼 Business Recommendations:
- Focus retention strategies on **younger, traveling employees** in Sales.  
- Improve career growth and compensation plans to reduce turnover.  
- Offer flexible or remote options for high-travel roles.
