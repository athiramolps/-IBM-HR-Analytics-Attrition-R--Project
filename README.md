# -IBM-HR-Analytics-Attrition-R--Project
The goal of the IBM HR Analytics Attrition Project is to understand the factors that influence employee attrition that is, why employees leave the company.

By analyzing HR data, the company can identify patterns that lead to attrition and take preventive measures such as improving working conditions, salary structures, or management style.
